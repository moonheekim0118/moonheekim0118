## Hello Strangers ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently focusing on Software Development, Especially Front-end with JavaScript. I've found out I love building things, so I started coding in the Spring of 2018, and I keep focusing on it to be a better software engineer. I wanna make a better world with software. <br/>
My life motto is **to Be the protagonist anywhere you stay, then the truth will be where you are.**  (éš¨è™•ä½œä¸» ç«‹è™•çš†çœŸ)
